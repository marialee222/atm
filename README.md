Simulation link: [ATM App](https://marialee222.github.io/atm/)

## Description 
The ATM app allows users to simulate depositing or withdrawing cash. It offers a form where users can select either a deposit or cashback operation, input the desired amount, and submit the transaction. The application's state is managed through React's useState hook, ensuring dynamic updates to the total account balance and transaction validation. Styling is handled using CSS, providing a clean and user-friendly interface.
